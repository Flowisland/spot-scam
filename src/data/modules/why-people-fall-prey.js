          <p>She was smart, educated, and tech-savvy enough to use online banking. But the caller sounded so professional, knew her computer brand, and created such urgency that her brilliant medical mind went into panic mode.</p>

            <h3>Your Brain is Actually Working PERFECTLY</h3>
            <p>Scammers exploit normal human psychology</p>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Here's what happens when scammers call:</strong></p>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>Your Brain Goes Into "Emergency Mode"</h4>
            <p>When scared or rushed, your brain shuts down logical thinking and focuses only on solving the "crisis" quickly. This is normal survival instinct!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>Your Good Qualities Work Against You</h4>
            <p>Being polite (not hanging up), helpful (wanting to solve problems), and trusting (believing authority figures) are wonderful traits - but scammers know this!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>They Use "Social Proof"</h4>
            <p>"Everyone else is doing this..." "This is standard procedure..." Your brain assumes if others are doing it, it must be safe.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>The Authority Trick</h4>
            <p>They impersonate doctors, police, banks, government. Your brain is wired to trust authority - it's how society works!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>The Urgency Trap</h4>
            <p>"Your account will be closed in one hour!" Time pressure stops you from thinking, checking, or asking others for advice.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>The Isolation Strategy</h4>
            <p>"Don't tell anyone about this call." They know that talking to others breaks their spell. Your family would spot the scam immediately!</p>

          <div class="info-box-red">
            <h4>The Embarrassment Factor</h4>
